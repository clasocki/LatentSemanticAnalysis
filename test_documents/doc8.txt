Ratcheting up the rancour, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled aggressively in a Democratic presidential debate on Sunday night over trade, Wall Street influence and more, with Mrs Clinton accusing him of turning his back on the auto industry and Sanders countering that Clinton's friends on Wall Street had "destroyed this economy".
It was a marked change in tone for the two Democrats, signalling Mr Sanders' increasingly difficult effort to slow the party's front-runner. Both candidates frequently interrupted one another and accused each other of misrepresenting their records.
"Let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change," Mrs Clinton snapped at her rival at one point.
"Let me tell my story, you tell yours," he shot back at another. "Your story is voting for every disastrous trade amendment and voting for corporate America."
More than once, Mr Sanders chafed at Mrs Clinton's interruptions, saying, "Excuse me, I'm talking" or "Let me finish, please."
